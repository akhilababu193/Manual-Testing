# Manual-Testing
# Project Name: 
E-commerce Website Testing
# Objective: To thoroughly test the functionality and user experience of an e-commerce website.
# Project Scope:
Test all major features of the e-commerce website, including product browsing, search functionality, cart management, checkout process, user registration, and account management.
Test the website on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
Verify compatibility with different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).
Perform both positive and negative testing to uncover any issues or bugs.
Ensure the website is user-friendly, secure, and performs well under different load conditions.
# Test Phases:
# 1-Test Planning:
Understand the requirements and functionalities of the e-commerce website.
Identify test scenarios and prioritize them based on criticality.
Define test objectives, test environment, and test data requirements.
Prepare the test strategy and test plan document.
# 2- Test Case Design:
Create detailed test cases for each identified test scenario.
Include steps, expected results, and any preconditions or test data required.
Cover various aspects such as UI, functionality, navigation, and error handling.
Ensure test cases are clear, concise, and easy to understand.
# 3-Test Execution:
Set up the test environment with the required hardware and software configurations.
Execute the test cases according to the defined test plan.
Log any defects or issues encountered during testing.
Capture screenshots or videos as evidence for bug reports.
Retest the resolved defects to ensure they have been fixed.
# 4-Regression Testing:
Perform regression testing to ensure that bug fixes or new features do not introduce any new issues.
Execute a subset of test cases covering critical functionalities.
Verify the overall stability and integrity of the e-commerce website.
# 5-Usability Testing:
Evaluate the website's user-friendliness and ease of navigation.
Validate the website's responsiveness across different devices and screen sizes.
Check for consistent branding, proper labeling, and intuitive user interfaces.
Gather user feedback to identify areas of improvement.
# 6-Performance Testing:
Measure the website's performance under different load conditions.
Conduct load testing to determine the system's capacity and response times.
Monitor resource utilization to identify bottlenecks or performance issues.
Ensure the website can handle peak traffic without significant slowdowns.
# 7-Security Testing:
Assess the website's security measures, including authentication and authorization mechanisms.
Test for vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and session management flaws.
Verify secure communication using SSL/TLS protocols.
Ensure sensitive user data is properly protected and encrypted.
8-Test Summary and Reporting:
Document the test results, including test execution status, defects found, and their severity.
Provide a summary of the overall test coverage and test completion metrics.
Prepare a final test report with recommendations for improvements.
Conduct a test closure meeting to discuss the project's o
